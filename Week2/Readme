Understand digital design, SoC architecture, and RISC-V integration
Learn the design flow: from RTL to GDSII
Simulate and synthesize a full chip using open-source tools
Library: Sky130 PDK

What Does BabySoC Include?
A RISC-V core
PLL
10-bit DAC
Written in Verilog for simulation and synthesis
Integrates cleanly with OpenLANE, the open-source ASIC flow
