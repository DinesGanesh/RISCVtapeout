# RISCVtapeout
10 Weeks Schedule of RISC-V VSD_IITGN

Tool Installation: (OpenSource) 
1.Yosys  - Synthesis 
2.iVerilog - Verilog Simualtion
3.GTK Wave - Waveform Viewer

DAY1: 
Initial introduction of Test Bench & Stimulus (Test Vectors)
- Tried to create a new verilog file with a simple XOR gate.
- Developed test bench(tb) for the XOR gate.
- Fixed some bugs with the tb Code with the dumpvars.
- compiler using iverilog, created dump value file and viewed waveform using gtkwave analyser.
