Week3:

**Gate Level simulation of BabySOC** -

**Tool: Yosys **
1.Reading Verilog files
2.Reading Library files
3.synth -top
4.Optimization and Technology mapping
5.Finally Staticstics 

output Post synthesis netlist.v

**Tool: iverilog -o**
1.run the netlist file using necessary dependent design files and library files.
2.waveform viewing the same dump file created in the previous step. 
3.Anaog Waveform format of "dout" is clearly the same as that fo functional simulation. (Week2)
