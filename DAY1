Day1 : Waveform and Screenshots
Day 1 Completed
Tasks Accomplished:

✔️ Designed and coded a XOR gate in Verilog
✔️ Simulated the XOR gate using Icarus Verilog (iverilog)
✔️ Visualized the simulation waveform using GTKWave
✔️ Synthesized the design with Yosys

Tools Used:
iverilog – for simulation
vvp – for running the compiled simulation
gtkwave – for viewing waveforms
yosys – for synthesis and RTL analysis
Output Highlights:

Functional simulation with correct XOR behavior
Waveform confirms expected transitions
Synthesis summary from Yosys with logic optimization
